# Meeting
#### Agenda 
Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: The agenda included all important meeting points, which is great, but the formatting could be improved for clarity as everything is in bold. Additionally, it was uploaded slightly late (1 day before the meeting instead of 2). Overall, **sufficient** with potential for better organization and timing.



#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: The notes were clear and well-structured overall. However, there were a few issues. 
Accuracy: The deadline for the Code of Conduct was incorrectly noted as Sunday, December 1st, when it should be Friday, November 29th. Such details are critical and need to be verified.
Relevance: While clarity is appreciated, some notes, such as "The team reflected on the meeting process," seemed unnecessary and could be omitted to keep the notes concise.
On a positive note, the notes included clear agreements, assigned tasks, and were actionable and realistic, which demonstrates good minute-taking skills.



#### Chair performance
Quick Summary: Insufficient/Sufficient/Good/Excellent

Feedback: The chair did well and made sure all topics were covered. Sometimes the chair could have been more leading, by giving  conclusions to certain discussions and then moving on. E.g: "Okey so let's implement X by Y, and Z will do this before friday, now onto ..."



#### Attitude & Relation
Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: The team had a positive and friendly atmosphere, which is great. However, the meeting felt a bit chaotic at times, and not everyoneâ€™s input was fully heard. While most were active, some confusion lingered. Improving structure and listening would help.
